There are 2 components, 1st is a DotNet Core API to retrieve data from MS SQL Server database and 2nd is a ReactJS Front End application to call this API and display data to user. 

They are in 2 separate zip files, "Abhay_StarWars_API.zip" and "Abhay_StarWars_Client.zip".

DotNet Core API is having 4 HTTP Get methods which translates to 4 reuirements asked in test and same 4 will be displayed in ReactJS front end application.

Both DotNet Core and ReactJS application still need some work in terms of error handling and look & feel for ReactJS front end application.
